<h3>What is AB testing and why we use?</h3>
<p>
AB Testing is a statistical analysis for comparing two groups that representing the main population each other to determine which one performs better. A group is representing the control group and B group is representing the test group. AB testing is used to understand bussiness problems such as group B is known to perform better, but whether this result occured by chance. For example does changing a button on a website affect sales? Is there statistically significant difference between the means of the two versions? Is it worth implementing this project in terms of time and effort?

<h3>Case Study</h3>
University of Montana conducted an examination on the three main buttons on its homapage of website and found that the "Interact" button was clicked much less than the others. Instead of this button, they tried 4 different versions and watched for one month and they want to do ab test for the analysis of the results.
