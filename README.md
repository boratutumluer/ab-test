<h3>What is AB testing and why we use?</h3>
<p>
AB Testing is a statistical analysis for comparing two groups that representing the main population each other to determine which one performs better. A group is representing the control group and B group is representing the test group. AB testing is used to understand bussiness problems such as group B is known to perform better, but whether this result occured by chance. For example does changing a button on a website affect sales? is there statistically significant difference between the means of the two versions? Is it worth implementing this project in terms of time and effort?
